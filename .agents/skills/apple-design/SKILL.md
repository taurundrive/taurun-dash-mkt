# Apple Design

How Apple builds interfaces that stop feeling like a computer and start feeling like an extension of you. This knowledge comes from Apple's WWDC design talks — chiefly *Designing Fluid Interfaces* (WWDC 2018) — distilled and translated into the web platform (CSS, Pointer Events, `requestAnimationFrame`, spring libraries like Motion/Framer Motion).

The through-line: **an interface feels alive when motion starts from the current on-screen value, inherits the user's velocity, projects momentum forward, and can be grabbed and reversed at any instant.** Springs are the tool that makes all of this natural, because they are inherently interruptible and velocity-aware.

## The Core Idea

> "When we align the interface to the way we think and move, something magical happens — it stops feeling like a computer and starts feeling like a seamless extension of us."

An interface is fluid when it behaves like the physical world: things respond instantly, move continuously, carry momentum, resist at boundaries, and can be redirected mid-motion.

## 1. Response — kill latency

The moment lag appears, the feeling of directness "falls off a cliff." Response is the foundation everything else is built on.

- **Respond on pointer-down, not on release.** Highlight a button the instant it's pressed. Waiting for `click`/touch-up to show feedback feels dead.
- **Be vigilant about every latency.** Audit debounces, artificial timers, transition waits, and the ~300ms tap delay.
- **Feedback must be continuous *during* the interaction, not just at the end.** For a drag, slider, or drawer, update the UI 1:1 with the pointer the whole way through.

```css
/* Feedback lives on the press, and it's instant */
.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
  transition: transform 100ms ease-out;
}
```

## 2. Direct manipulation — 1:1 tracking

> "Touch and content should move together."

When the user drags something, it must stay glued to the finger — and respect the offset from *where they grabbed it*. Snapping to the element's center on grab breaks the illusion immediately.

- Use Pointer Events with `setPointerCapture` so tracking continues even when the pointer leaves the element's bounds.
- Track a short **velocity/position history** (last few `pointermove` events), not just the current point.

## 3. Interruptibility — the single most important principle

> "The thought and the gesture happen in parallel."

Every animation must be interruptible and redirectable at any moment. A user must be able to grab a moving element mid-flight and reverse it without waiting for the animation to finish.

- **Never lock out input during a transition.**
- **Always animate from the *presentation* (current) value, never the target value.** On interrupt, read the element's live on-screen transform and start the new animation from there.
- **Avoid CSS transitions and `@keyframes` for anything gesture-driven.** Springs animate from the current value by default.
- **When a gesture reverses, blend velocity — don't hard-cut it.**

## 4. Behavior over animation — use springs

> "Think of animation as a conversation between you and the object, not something prescribed by the interface."

Apple deliberately replaced the physics triplet (mass/stiffness/damping) with two designer-friendly parameters:
- **Damping ratio** — controls overshoot. `1.0` = critically damped, no bounce, smooth settle. `< 1.0` = overshoots and oscillates. Lower = bouncier.
- **Response** — how quickly the value reaches the target, in seconds. Lower = snappier. **This is not "duration"**.

**Defaults:**
- Start most UI at **damping `1.0`** (critically damped) — graceful and non-distracting.
- Add bounce (**damping ~`0.8`**) **only when the gesture itself carried momentum** (a flick, a throw, a drag release).

```js
import { animate } from 'motion';

// Critically damped default (no overshoot)
animate(el, { y: 0 }, { type: 'spring', bounce: 0, duration: 0.4 });

// Momentum interaction — a little bounce, only because a flick preceded it
animate(el, { y: target }, { type: 'spring', bounce: 0.2, duration: 0.4 });
```

## 5. Velocity handoff — the seam between drag and animation

When a gesture ends, the animation must **continue at the finger's exact velocity**, so there's no visible seam between dragging and animating.

Pass the pointer's release velocity as the spring's initial velocity:
```
relativeVelocity = gestureVelocity / (targetValue − currentValue)
```

## 6. Momentum projection — animate to where the gesture is *going*

> "Take a small input and make a big output."

Don't snap to the nearest boundary from the *release point*. Use velocity to **project the resting position** — exactly like scroll deceleration — then snap to the target nearest that projected point.

```js
function project(initialVelocity, decelerationRate = 0.998) {
  return (initialVelocity / 1000) * decelerationRate / (1 - decelerationRate);
}

const projectedEndpoint = currentPosition + project(releaseVelocity);
const target = nearestSnapPoint(projectedEndpoint);
animateSpringTo(target, { velocity: releaseVelocity });
```

## 7. Spatial consistency — symmetric paths, anchored origins

> "If something disappears one way, we expect it to emerge from where it came."

- **Enter and exit along the same path.** A panel that slides in from the right must dismiss to the right.
- **Anchor interactions to their source.** Set `transform-origin` to the trigger element.
- **Mirror the easing on reversible transitions.**
