name: animation-vocabulary
description: Reverse-lookup glossary that turns a vague description of a web animation or motion effect into its exact term ("the bouncy thing when a popover opens" -> Pop in; "the iOS rubber-band scroll" -> Rubber-banding). Use when the user asks "what's it called when...", or describes a motion effect without knowing its name and wants the right word to prompt an AI or designer with. For naming an effect, not designing or building one.

# Animation Vocabulary

Turn a vague description of a motion or effect into the precise term, so the user knows what to ask for.

## Quick Start

The user describes an effect loosely. You return the matching term(s) in this format:

```
**Stagger** — Animate several items one after another with a small delay between each, creating a cascade.
```

## Glossary

### Entrances & Exits
- **Fade in / Fade out** — Element appears or disappears by changing opacity.
- **Slide in** — Element enters by sliding in from off-screen (left, right, top, or bottom).
- **Scale in** — Element grows from smaller to full size as it appears, often paired with a fade.
- **Pop in** — Element appears with a slight overshoot, like it bounces into place.
- **Reveal** — Content is uncovered gradually, often by animating a clip-path or mask.
- **Enter / Exit** — The animation an element plays when it's added to or removed from the screen.

### Sequencing & Timing
- **Keyframes** — Defined points in an animation (0%, 50%, 100%) that the browser fills the gaps between.
- **Interpolation / Tween** — Generating all the in-between frames between a start and end value, so motion is continuous.
- **Stagger** — Animate several items one after another with a small delay between each, creating a cascade.
- **Orchestration** — Deliberately timing multiple animations so they feel like one coordinated motion.
- **Delay** — Time before an animation starts.
- **Duration** — How long an animation takes.

### Movement & Transforms
- **Translate** — Move an element along the X or Y axis.
- **Scale** — Make an element bigger or smaller.
- **Rotate** — Spin an element around a point.
- **Skew** — Slant an element along the X or Y axis, shearing it out of its rectangular shape.
- **Transform origin** — The anchor point a scale or rotation grows or spins from.
- **Origin-aware animation** — An element animates out of its trigger, like a popover growing from the button that opened it instead of from its own center.
- **Rubber-banding** — Resistance and snap-back when you drag past a boundary (the iOS overscroll feel).
- **Morph** — One shape smoothly turns into another shape, e.g. Dynamic Island.
